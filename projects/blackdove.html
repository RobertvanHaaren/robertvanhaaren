Together with their marketing and design team I created a branding guide and some examples that explain and show what resources are available and how to use them. This to ensure the Blackdove brand is used in a consistent and effective way across all of Blackdove's own products and the products of their partners. After the branding phase my attention was focused on creating and updating Blackdove's products with the new brand, design (UI,UX), QA testing, PM and the transition to Product lead.</p><h4 class="feature__sub-title h--weight-light push-top--small">Branding</h4><p class="p--big">The first step was defining the current brand and creating a brandbook so we were able to review this with the entire team. This helped us answer various questions like: Who are we? Why are we doing this? What is it we do? Who is our target audience? And does this translate to our company's mission, vision and goals.</p><p class="p--big"><strong>Defining the brand:</strong></p><p class="p--big">Blackdove is: Mindful, Stylish, Luxury, Smart, Interesting, Thoughtful, Polished, Customizable, Artist Friendly, Protective, Inclusive, Sophisticated, Modern, Cool, Minimalistic.</p><p class="p--big">Blackdove is not: Trendy & Outdated, Average, Risky, Ridged, Flexible, Cookie Cutter, Bold, Frivolous, Extravagant, Snobby, Clutter, Over The Top.</p></div><div class="story"><div class="container"><img class="img--faded" src="../www/img/projects/blackdove/01.blackdove-brand-01.jpg" alt="" data-onscreen-toggle="img--faded--visible"></div><div class="container container--text"><p class="p--big"><strong>Color</strong></p><p class="p--big">After the current brand was defined (see image above) we recognised where we needed to improve. First we needed to change our pink accent color to a color which would be more sophisticated, creative, luxurious and would represent a (digital) art brand at the same time. Our new color became <a style="color: #6173CF; border-bottom: 1px solid #6173CF" href="https://graf1x.com/color-psychology-emotion-meaning-poster/">purple/blue</a>.</p><p class="p--big"><strong>Font</strong></p><p class="p--big">We reduced the amount of fonts from 3 to 1. The three fonts are very similar and could be easily reduced to 1 font for more consistancy across the board.</p><p class="p--big"><strong>Logo</strong></p><p class="p--big">The next challenge was iterating the logo. It required to keep its brand recognition and we needed to improve the simplicity to gain more brand awareness and recall. The reversed white logo had to go, this would create too much confusion for our users since the name of the company was litarally "Black"dove. The stacked logo was removed too, the text Blackdove needed to be more present and the glyph of the logo should be presented next to the text and have a similar size so it would have the same level of importance. The glyph however could be used as a stand-alone element (e.g. on social, email marketing) but it should have the copy "Blackdove" near it on the same page somewhere when being used to create more brand recognition.</p><p class="p--big"><strong>New brand:</strong></p></div><div class="container"><img class="img--faded" src="../www/img/projects/blackdove/01.blackdove-brand-02.jpg" alt="" data-onscreen-toggle="img--faded--visible"></div><div class="container container--text"><h4 class="feature__sub-title h--weight-light push-top--small">UI-Kit</h4><p class="p--big">Now that we established the brand we could continue on all the UI-kit elements for the various Blackdove products (e.g. forms, buttons, lists, modals, dropdowns, etc), basically our own small design system. After designing all the elements I worked together with a talented front-end developer <a href="https://kvendrik.com/" target="_blank">Koen</a> which created a <a target="_blank" href="http://uikit-web.blackdove.io/">UI-Kit library</a> from my designs that could be implemented in most of the front-end products to create consistency across the platform.</p><h4 class="feature__sub-title h--weight-light push-top--small">Products</h4><p class="p--big">With the UI-Kit and Branding in place I could focus on the product. It was time to review user feedback, problem-solve and prioritize our next set of objectives.</p><p class="p--big"><strong>Mobile App</strong></p><p class="p--big">The mobile app is one of the core products of Blackdove. It controls the TV, let's the user discover art, create playlists and streams art to their tv's at home and work. We were ambitious to add more features but at that time we had a hybrid app and we knew we had to switch to a native app to prevent performance issues in the long run. So we did, this created the oppertunity to create new designs for the mobile app. I started with writing down all the ideas and features we wanted. This way we could prevent most of the flow issues for the future, after working out all the designs we could decide on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">MVP</a> for a first release.</p><p class="p--big"><strong>Flowchart</strong></p><p class="p--big">The tiles on the top right (image below) show the idea of swiping fullscreen artworks to left and right to discover artworks in the fastest way possible, swiping up and down would take the user to a next and previous playlist. When testing this functionality with our users we discovered that swiping left and right was a natural behaviour for them but swiping up and down through playlists had a learning curve for our users. This had to be fixed by adding an onboarding flow explaining this feature to our users.</p><p></p></div><div class="container"><img class="img--faded" src="../www/img/projects/blackdove/01.blackdove-brand-03.jpg" alt="" data-onscreen-toggle="img--faded--visible"></div><div class="container container--text"><p class="p--big"><strong>Wireframes</strong></p></div><div class="container"><img class="img--faded" src="../www/img/projects/blackdove/01.blackdove-brand-04.jpg" alt="" data-onscreen-toggle="img--faded--visible"></div><div class="container container--text"><p class="p--big"><strong>V1 Draft</strong></p><p class="p--big">Below a couple of our screens from the v1 app (right before the new brand was finished).</p></div><div class="container"><img class="img--faded" src="../www/img/projects/blackdove/01.blackdove-brand-05.jpg" alt="" data-onscreen-toggle="img--faded--visible"></div><div class="container container--text"><p class="p--big"><strong>V2 App</strong></p><p class="p--big">One of the big changes within this release was the transition from hamburger icon to bottom navigation and the new brand. We discovered that the hamburger icon would take the user too many clicks to get from one place to another, at the same time <a href="https://material.io/design/components/bottom-navigation.html" target="_blank">Material design</a> started to take off and the bottom nav started to become a standard, because of these reasons we replaced our hamburger menu with the bottom navigation.</p><p class="p--big">We also started to add rounded buttons to make them feel more clickable and less web like. We changed all our light modals to dark themed modals to make it more consistent with the rest of the app which also had a dark theme.</p></div><div class="container"><img class="img--faded" src="../www/img/projects/blackdove/01.blackdove-brand-06.jpg" alt="" data-onscreen-toggle="img--faded--visible"></div><div class="text-center"><a href="/" class="btn btn--big">Back to overview</a></div><footer class="mastfoot"><div class="text-center"><div class="social"><div class="social-logos"><a href="https://dribbble.com/RobertvanHaaren" target="_blank"><img class="transition-opacity" src="www/img/social/dribbble.svg" alt="dribbble social icon"> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertvanhaaren/" target="_blank"><img class="transition-opacity" src="www/img/social/linkedIn.svg" alt="linkedin social icon"></a><p><a class="logo" href="/" title="Robert van Haaren Homepage">R</a></p><a href="https://angel.co/robert-van-haaren" target="_blank"><img class="transition-opacity" src="www/img/social/angelco.svg" alt=""> </a><a href="https://creativemarket.com/RobertvanHaaren" target="_blank"><img class="transition-opacity" src="www/img/social/creativemarket.svg" alt=""></a></div></div></div><small>Robert van Haaren 2019<br>All food reserved</small></footer><script src="/www/js/app.js?1555096139209"></script></div></body></html>
