	<h4 class="feature__sub-title h--weight-light push-top--small">My Role at Codecov</h4>
	<p class="p--big">
	Around June 2019 Codecov had asked me to help them rethink their Product pages. When I joined Codecov at that time the team was consisting out of 10-15 people, 3 years later it had grown to over 50 people. 
	</p>
	<p class="p--big">
	The first 1.5 years at Codecov I've worked closely with their CTO Eli Hooten. The entire product needed a design overhaul. The product needed a closer look with research, competitor comparison, deciding what is important (and what isn't). We really needed to understand the product and how our users are using and experiencing it to iterate and increase its value. 
	</p>

	<h4 class="feature__sub-title h--weight-light push-top--small">Use-case 1: Accessibility (color blindness)</h4>
	<p class="p--big">
	<strong>Problem:</strong> When digging into our user feedback (support tickets, twitter, etc) it became clear we had <a class="underline" href="https://www.getfeedback.com/resources/ux/how-to-design-for-color-blindness/" target="_blank">color blind users</a> that were struggeling with understanding sunbursts, graphs, etc because we indicate a lot with color inside our portal. Roughly 4-8% of the visitors that visit a website or app are colorblind. 
	<img src="/../www/img/projects/codecov/color-blindness/1.png">
	</p>
	<p class="p--big">To accomendate the same experience for all our users I started converting our current colors to "colorblind colors" so I could experience the same problem. When converting them I saw there were 3 types of colorblindness where the contrast would be barely visible for our current red and green colors (screenshot below).</p>
	<img src="/../www/img/projects/codecov/color-blindness/2.png">
	<p class="p--big"><strong>Experimenting:</strong> I started focussing on those 3 types of colorblindness and experimented with 5 versions of green and red to see which colors work best in terms of contrast and to present them to the team. I also added the versions into our coverage reach chart we use inside the Codecov Portal as an example. Our goal was to pick the colors with enough contrast but without compromising the look and feel for the non colorblind users too much.</p>
	<img src="/../www/img/projects/codecov/color-blindness/3.png">
	<img src="/../www/img/projects/codecov/color-blindness/4.png">
	<img src="/../www/img/projects/codecov/color-blindness/5.png">
	<p class="p--big">As you can see above we were also trying patterns as an addition e.g. diagonal lines vs horizontal/vertical lines to even more differentiate between the colors.</p>
	<p class="p--big"> After we've picked our version, it was time to do the same for our sunburst graph, which currently had 10 colors between green and red to indicate how much e.g. a folder or file is covered. The challenge (as you can see below) is that with a lot of colors its becoming nearly impossible to create a contrast from light to dark for our colorblind users.</p>
	<img src="/../www/img/projects/codecov/color-blindness/6.png" width="900px">
	<br /><br />
	<p class="p--big">We reduced the amount of colors to 7, 6 or 5 color versions. We have to take into consideration is that each color indicates a percentage, so if we reduce the colors we have a less precise idea of how much or less a file or folder is covered, so naturally we want to have the most colors but on the condition that our colorblind users can still see enough contrast to keep them apart.</p>
	<img src="/../www/img/projects/codecov/color-blindness/7.png" width="900px">
	<p class="p--big"><strong>Solution:</strong> We picked for a 7 color variant (7 steps between 0% and 100% coverage). This would still give us enough indication of how much a file or folder is covered and it would still give us enough contrast for our color blind users. Out of version 6 and 7 we picked 6 because the colors looked a little more fresh and brighter than version 7.</p>

	<h4 class="feature__sub-title h--weight-light push-top--small">User Experience</h4>
	<p class="p--big">
	The first thing I started doing when I joined Codecov was walking through the entire product and catch the most obvious UX flaws. For instance Codecov's top navigation bar which behaved like <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/breadcrumbs-in-web-design-examples-and-best-practices/" title="" class="underline">breadcrumbs</a> but visually looked like it was just a normal functioning navigation bar (meaning that when you clicked on a menu item it would take you to a different page and the menu would always stay/look the same). Since this is unexpected behavior to a user they might get confused, since they expect it working like a normal functioning navigation bar because so many other websites do it this way <a href="https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/" target="_blank" class="underline">(Jakob's Law)</a>. I came up with a navigation bar design with interactions to solve this problem:</p>

	<section class="slickin-slide">

	      <video width="960" height="720" controls>
  			<source src="/../www/img/projects/codecov/interactions/compare-page.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  		</video>
	    </div>

		<a href="/../www/img/projects/codecov/top-nav/top-nav.pdf" class="btn btn--big" target="_blank">
			Functional Spec
		</a>
	</div>

	<p class="p--big">
	By adding chevrons to the top bar it's now indicating it are breadcrumbs, and by adding subtle animations the user can now visually see what is changing. By adding a hover over the breadcrumbs the user can easily select a different organisation, repository, etc and change the breadcrumb path for a better understanding how everything ties together. This is one of the UX items I worked on as an example.
	</p>

	<p class="p--big">
	<strong>Analyse</strong> Receiving user data is important, that's why we used <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/" class="underline" target="_blank">Fullstory</a> to track how users are experiencing Codecov's product. This enabled us to see rage-clicks, deadlinks, heatmaps, movements, user session recordings, etc. This would also mean we could compare with newer versions and see if it resolves the issue, increases value, hit our <a target="_blank" class="underline" href="https://www.klipfolio.com/resources/articles/what-is-a-key-performance-indicator">success metrics</a> and targets <a href="https://vwo.com/ab-testing/" class="underline" target="_blank">(a/b test)</a>.
	</p>
	<p class="p--big">
	<strong>User interviews</strong> Watching recorded user feedback sessions and attending them helped us understand things like: why are our users using us?, what do they like about our product? and what do they not understand or don't like? / find confusing? Seeing a user use your product and see them e.g. struggeling on certain pages helped us creating a better experience for our users.
