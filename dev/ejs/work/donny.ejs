	<p class="p--big">
		Me and my colleague <a href="https://vdweem.xyz/" target="_blank" class="underline">Matti</a> love working on side projects in our spare time. We created an app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duxilio.sock" target="_blank" class="underline">Sock</a> (securely lock) which lets users store images securly, locally and password protected on their mobile phone. However we had some bills to pay in terms of server costs and we didn't want to annoy our users with in-app commercials or creating a premium/paid version of the app. One of the business models that came to mind was crowdfunding, we looked for tools online that would help us crowdfund for our app (to cover our server costs, develop more features, resolve problems) unfortunetely we couldn't find any and that was the moment when <a href="https://donny.fund" class="underline" target="_blank">donny.fund</a> was born.

	<h4 class="feature__sub-title h--weight-light">Defining the USP's</h4>

	<p class="p--big">
		Now that we had our first customer (ourselves) we already figured out our first USP: creating a business model based on cruwdfunding inside a software project to avoid adding commercials or creating a premium app. We took the time to brainstorm on more USP's to create more value out of our newly created concept:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="p--big ul-list">Have your next project or feature funded by your community.</p></li>
		<li><p class="p--big ul-list">Let your audience select the donation amount they wish to donate to support the cause.</p></li>
		<li><p class="p--big ul-list">Let your users request features to determine your roadmap based on real user needs.</p></li>
		<li><p class="p--big ul-list">Easily discover your priorities by getting insight into the number of donations and feature upvotes.</p></li>
	</ul>

	<h4 class="feature__sub-title h--weight-light">Coming up with a name</h4>

	<p class="p--big">
		About the name Donny.fund: We needed to come up with a name so we wrote down everything to do with crowdfunding. We picked a few words out of our mindmap: Donation, Money and Funding. You probably already see were this is going, we combined the words Don(ation) and (Mon)ny to Donny and we found out that there was a .fund domein which we could use and that's how the Donny.fund name was founded.

	<h4 class="feature__sub-title h--weight-light">Look and Feel</h4>

	<p class="p--big">
		The color which we thought came closest to (donny) donations, money and funding was green. The entire product needed to feel light and open, allowing users to feel safe when donating to their favorite product, knowing it would help their creators to evolve the product for them. That's why we came up with the following colors: backgrounds should be light or light grey to feel open, the texts would be blue grey and the accent colors should be green/blue turqoise. We also added a few more prominent colors for error/warning and info pop-ups.

	<h4 class="feature__sub-title h--weight-light">For the creators</h4>

	<p class="p--big">
		The creators needed to be able to create features in our Donny portal where they could assign a goal based on how long they would be working on a feature. This way their community can fund them so when the goal has been reached it can be picked up for development. The community would be able to leave feature suggestions and upvote them as well so that the creators know which feature has the highest priority. Then the creator can add a goal to a suggestion so it becomes ready for funding.
