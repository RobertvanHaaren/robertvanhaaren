	<p class="p--big">
		Me and my colleague <a href="https://vdweem.xyz/" target="_blank" class="underline">Matti</a> love working on side projects in our spare time. We created an app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duxilio.sock" target="_blank" class="underline">Sock</a> (securely lock) which lets users store images securely, locally and password protected on their mobile phone. However we had some bills to pay in terms of server costs and we didn't want to annoy our users with in-app commercials or by offering  a premium/paid version of the app. One of the other ways to fund our efforts that  came to mind was crowdfunding. We looked for tools online that would help us crowdfund for our app but unfortunately  we couldn't find any. We figured we couldn’t be the only ones who need a tool like this and decided to build our own.

	<h4 class="feature__sub-title h--weight-light">Defining Donnny.fund</h4>

	<p class="p--big">
		We made Donny.fund to allow ourselves and others to fund their apps using crowdfunding so they can keep their apps free and don’t have to rely on alternative less ideal business models like ads. When we started the build process the first thing we did is brainstorm and come up with some goals to define what <a href="https://donny.fund/" target="_blank" class="underline">Donny.fund</a> should enable people to do:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="p--big ul-list">Have your community fund your project or feature.</p></li>
		<li><p class="p--big ul-list">Be flexible about how much is donated to keep the barrier to donate as low as possible.</p></li>
		<li><p class="p--big ul-list">Allow users to suggest new features that can be upvoted so makers get a good feel of what their community wants and how much they want it. This way Donny cannot just be used to fund projects and features but also to close the gap between creators and their users.</p></li>
	</ul>

<div class="container container--text push-top--medium">
	<h4 class="feature__sub-title h--weight-light">Coming up with a name</h4>

	<p class="p--big">
		To come up with the name we simply picked a few words out of our mind map: Donation, Money and Funding. You probably already see where this is going: we combined the words Don(ation) and (Mon)ny which became Donny and we discovered that there was a .fund domain available which we could use. And that's how the Donny.fund name came to be.
	</p>

<div class="container container--text push-top--medium">
	<h4 class="feature__sub-title h--weight-light">Look and Feel</h4>

	<p class="p--big">
		The color which we thought came closest to (donny) donations, money and funding was green. The entire product needed to feel light and open, allowing users to feel safe when donating to their favorite product, knowing it would help their creators to evolve the product for them. That's why we came up with the following colors: backgrounds should be light or light grey to feel open, the texts would be blue grey and the accent colors should be green/blue turqoise. We also added a few more prominent colors for error/warning and info pop-ups.

		We used <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa?selection.family=Comfortaa:400,700" target="_blank" class="underline">Comfortaa</a> as our main font. It needed to feel friendly and modern so we went with this rounded sans-serif font. However we discovered that when we used this font for longer texts it wouldn't look and read well, so we had to add a secondary font for longer texts (<a href="https://donny.fund/sample" target="_blank" class="underline">Blog posts</a>). We decided to go for a serif font like <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank" class="underline">Medium</a> does it for their articles (they would have done the research for it since articles are their main USP), when testing fonts on readablity I decided to go with: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif?selection.family=Noto+Serif" target="_blank" class="underline">Noto Serif</a>.

	<h4 class="feature__sub-title h--weight-light">For the creators</h4>

	<p class="p--big">
		The creators needed to be able to create features in our Donny portal where they could assign a financial goal to a feature based on the cost involved in developing it. The community can then fund these features and when the goal has been reached it can be picked up for development. The community would also be able to leave feature suggestions and upvote features so that the creators know what features the community would like to see and to get a good sense of what features are in highest demand. Creators can then add a financial goal to a suggestion so it becomes ready for funding.
